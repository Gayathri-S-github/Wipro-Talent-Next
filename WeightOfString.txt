Take a string as input and calculates the weight of the string as per rule mentioned below.

For calculating the weight of the string Weight of all alphabetic characters that appear in the string should be added

-Weight of vowels that appear in the string should either be ignored OR added depending upon a specified option

-All non-alphabetic characters in the string should be ignored

- Weight of each letter is its position in the english alphabet system,i.e weight of a=1,weight of b=2,weight of c=3,weight of d=4 and so on...            weight of y=25, weight of z=26

- Weight of upper-case and Lower-Case letters should be taken as the same, i.e weight of A=a=1,weight of B=b=1, weight of C=c=1 and so on..    weight of Z=z=26

- In a strings if all the character are numbers or special characters or its combination then return 0

Note:

Note that weight of vowels is ignored.Also note that the weight of non-alphbetic characters such as space character and ! is taken as zero.

 

The function will accept two input parameters input1 and input2,

where,

input1represents the string whose weight needs to be calculated

input2 represents the option specifying whether or not the weight of vowels should be included

if input2 is 0,vowels that appear in the string should be ignored

if input2 is 1,weight of vowels that appear in the string should also be added.
